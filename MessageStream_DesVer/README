In order to run the files move to the main directory
Then build, in the terminal run "rustc src/main.rs" for the designated verifier test, or "rustc src/message_stream.rs"
Then to execute use "./main" and "./message_stream" respectively
NOTE: The main file may need to be run using the run button mentioned below to cause it to import dependencies more easily.



The desVer runs each algorithm 1,000 times and finds the average execution times. I ran it using the "run" button on VScode because it requires the Cargo.tml file for the dependencies it has.

To change the expirement for message streams simply update the expirement variable.
The message streams test, runs 100 bulk and 10 priority messages to see the order of execution, to update the test to see the percentage of each instruction type executed, simply change the for loops to execute for 125, and then count the amount of each type run before the 1 minute mark.
